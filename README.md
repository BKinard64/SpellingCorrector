# SpellingCorrector
This Java program takes a single string as input and returns a suggestion for a similar correctly-spelled word. If the word is spelled correctly then it will just return
the input word. Suggestions are based on a dictionary that is loaded into the program at the time of execution. This program functions similarly to common spell-check features
such as the one in Microsoft Word.
